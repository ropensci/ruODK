## Problem
<!--
     Please briefly describe your problem.
-->
## ruODK function(s) used
<!--
     The most important bit - which ruODK functions did you use?
-->

## Unexpected behaviour
<!--
    Run the failing commands with verbose=TRUE and provide any error messages,
    and the time elapsed. Did the command fail straight away or run for a while?
    Could this be a networking issue or performance issues on the ODK Central server?
-->

## Reproducible example
<!--
     If this issue refers to a bug or unexpected behaviour of ruODK,
     please include a minimal reproducible example
     ([reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/), see also
     <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>).

     Note: If this issue involves an authenticated web request,
     do not include your credentials, server address, or any identifying
     information.
     Instead, run ru_setup() with environment variables.
     Make sure to sanitise any output of credentials, too.

     The failing function and the (sanitised) error output alone
     will be a welcome help to narrow down the problem.
