- title: OData API
  desc: >
    Top-level functions to retrieve and parse data via the OData API.
    These functions alone are enough to retrieve all submissions with their
    nested tables and attachments and parse their datatypes.
    See `vignette("odata-api")` for a walkthrough.

- title: Forms
  desc: >
    Functions to manage forms.
    Once their implementation is completed,
    these functions can be used to manage the life cycle of forms from drafts
    to published forms, their retirement, form permissions, as well as form
    attachments.

- title: Submissions
  desc: >
    Functions to manage submissions and their attachments.
    This family of functions provides an alternative way to the OData family.
    Specifically, submissions include nested tables in each record.
    See `vignette("restful-api")` for a walkthrough.

    Functions to assist with retrieval and parsing of submissions and their
