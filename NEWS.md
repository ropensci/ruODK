# ruODK 1.5.0
## Major changes
* Support Entities and Entity Lists (Datasets) (#152)
* Add pre-commit hooks and precommit.ci integration
* Add devcontainer

# ruODK 1.4.2
This release migrates the `ruODK` test suite to a new test server
`ruodk.getodk.cloud` which was generously sponsored by GetODK.

This release makes `ruODK` aware of the new ODK Central semantic version format:
Update your ODK Central version in `.Renviron` or in the credential
helper of your choice to the new format `ODKC_VERSION="2023.5.1"` (with your
current version). See the updated vignette "setup".

## Major changes
* Handle the new ODK Central semantic versioning (#150)
* Migrate to new test server (#149)

# ruODK 1.4.0
This release fixes a few compatibility issues and bumps dependencies to R (4.1)
and imported/suggested packages.
Upgrade carefully and revert to 1.3.12 if things go awry.

* Update to new `tidyselect` syntax: Using vectors of names to select makes
  `tidyselect` complain (WARN, soon ERROR). We wrap all programmatic selections
  of variable names in `dplyr::all_of()` where we expect a single variable to be
  selected, and `dplyr::any_of()` where we select using fuzzy matching
  (e.g. `dplyr::starts_with()`). (#146)
* Make `ruODK::form_list()` robust against `reviewState` missing from outdated
  Central versions. (#145, HT @dpagendam and #143, HT @collinschwantes)
  There will be more such tripwires - please do submit a bug report if you find
  a discrepancy between Central API and ruODK's parsing.

# ruODK 1.3.12

# ruODK 1.3.11
* Update `project_list`, `submission_list` and `` columns to reflect Central 1.5 API output.
* Update `submission_list` columns to reflect Central 1.5 API output.


# ruODK 1.3.10

# ruODK 1.3.9

# ruODK 1.3.8

# ruODK 1.3.7
## Minor fixes
* Improve issue template for bug reports
* Upgrade test server to ODK Central 1.4.2
* Refresh packaged data (new Central brings new fields), update tests
* Improve GitHub Action for Docker build

# `ruODK` 1.3.6
## Minor fixes
* `odata_submission_get` supports parameter `expand` to expand all repeat
  repetitions.

# `ruODK` 1.3.5
## Minor fixes
* `split_geopoint` is now robust against all NULL columns.
  `split_geotrace` and `split_geoshape` are possibly affected.
## Data
* Packaged data has been re-created to represent the latest server outputs.
## Maintenance
* New Suggest depencency `terra` (through `mapview`)

# `ruODK` 1.3.0
This release supports ODK Central 1.3.0 and represents an over-due version
bump to reflect the supported ODK Central version.
The test server is now updated to ODK Central 1.3.0, and all tests pass.

There are still some newer and as yet unsupported API endpoints in ODK Central,
which serve administrative purposes of the front-end. Contributions are welcome,
get started on [these issues](https://github.com/ropensci/ruODK/milestone/2)
and the contributing guide. As ruODK focuses on data retrieval, these
administrative endpoints are non-critical to ruODK's purpose.

* Packaged data has been re-created to represent the latest server outputs.
## Maintenance
* All tests pass, GitHub Actions is as per usual brittle at the installation
  step.

# `ruODK` 1.2.0.0000
We are shaping up to a release targetting the ODK Central 1.2 release.
ODK Central is undergoing some bug fixes and patches, while ruODK's test server
will be migrated to another instance. The latter is required to enable tests
which create/update/delete entities in ODK Central.

## Major fixes

# `ruODK` 0.9.11
## Major fixes
## Minor fixes
* Add `published_at` to `form_list` and `form_detail`, update examples, tests,
  test fixtures to show that draft forms can be detected by a NA `published_at`
  in ODK Central versions having form drafts, and by NA `hash` and `version`
  in ODK Central versions before form drafts.

# `ruODK` 0.9.10
This is a "everything so far works" release.
There are a few ODK Central API endpoints waiting to be implemented still.

## Major fixes
## Minor fixes
* Default ODK Central version bumped to current release (1.1)
## Documentation
* PDF manual updated
* Welcoming new contributors Marcelo (@mtyszler) and Hélène (@Thaliehln)
## Data
## Maintenance
* Updated Zenodo archive at <https://zenodo.org/record/4609910>
* Updated Docker image at <https://hub.docker.com/u/dbcawa/ruodk>
  (RStudio server with ruODK)

# `ruODK` 0.9.9
## Major fixes
* `submission_export` now supports ODK Central v1.1 features to omit media
  attachments (`media = FALSE`), and to omit repeat data (`include_repeats=FALSE`).
  Calling `submission_export` on an older version of ODK Central
  (as determined through `get_default_odkc_version()`) with these new parameters
  will emit a (verbose only) "noop" message and not act further on them.
## Minor fixes
* Bugfix to `submission_export` on encrypted forms with multiple encryption
  keys. (Thanks @Thaliehln #117 #30)

# `ruODK` 0.9.8
## Minor fixes
* Add support for passphrase to the `ru_setup` family (#116)


# `ruODK` 0.9.7
## Major fixes
* `odata_submission_get()` bugfix: `handle_ru_attachments()`
  now finds and downloads media attachments from both main submissions and
  nested form groups. (#114)
* `odata_submission_get()` bugfix: missing media attachments (due to upload
  error from ODK Collect to ODK Central) are tolerated without interrupting the
  batch download. A diagnostic warning message will be emitted for each failed
  download. (#114)
## Minor fixes
## Documentation
## Data
## Maintenance

# `ruODK` 0.9.6
## Major fixes
* Support encryption (#30 #110, @Thaliehln).
  * Note that `ruODK` only supports one passphrase. When switching between
    multiple encrypted forms, it would make sense to store the different
    passphrases in separate environment variables, and refer to these environment
    variables explicitly in function calls.
  * The updated ruODK::submission_export should now export data
    from both encrypted projects and non-encrypted projects.
    The HTTP method is changed from GET to POST and encryption key ID /
    passphrase are provided via POST body using a JSON format.
    Encrypted forms can be extracted and inspected like non-encrypted forms:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
se <- submission_export()
t <- tempdir()
f <- unzip(se, exdir = t)
fs::dir_ls(t)
fid <- get_test_fid()
sub <- fs::path(t, glue::glue("Locations.csv")) %>% readr::read_csv()
sub %>% knitr::kable(.)
```

# `ruODK` 0.9.5

  Delete the local cache `tests/fixtures` to re-generate the vcr cache, or
  enjoy much faster running tests using cached server response.

# `ruODK` 0.9.3
This is a point release to create a new RStudio Server image.
## Minor fixes
* Form schema now also works on draft forms (#103, HT @dmenne).
## Maintenance
* Automated code reviews by <codefactor.io>.
* GitHub Actions welcomes Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and MacOS X back to the passing
  environments.

# `ruODK` 0.9.2
## Major fixes
* `form_schema_ext()` Shows the extended schema of one form, including
  (multi-language) labels and choice lists. (#77, thanks @mtyszler for the PR)
* Development continues in the default branch `main`.
## Minor fixes
* `form_list` now handles draft forms with `NA` hash and version (#86,
  thanks @dmenne for the PR).
* Migrate package tests to a new ODK Central instance and update contributing
  guidelines with new settings. (#14)
* Drop Import of `tidyselect` in favour of using `dplyr::all_of()`.
* All calls to `httr::RETRY(times=)` are configurable via setting `retries`. (#94)
## Documentation
* Mapview popups in vignette "Spatial" are back after an upstream
  bugfix is in progress (https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview/issues/312).

# `ruODK` 0.9.1
## Major fixes
ODK Central versions 0.7 to 0.9 export geotraces and geoshapes via OData with
a trailing empty coordinate. `ruODK` removes any trailing empty coordinates from
both GeoJSON and WKT formats. (#88, HT @TimonWeitkamp for the bug report)

## Documentation
A new vignette "Spatial" demonstrates how to parse spatial data into native
formats, such as `sf`, and gives pointers on what to do next with them.


# `ruODK` 0.9.0
This is the release on passing
[rOpenSci peer review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/335).

Thanks to the rOpenSci editors and reviewers @maelle, @karissawhiting and
@jmt2080ad, as well as to @OdiljonQurbon, @dickoa, @arestrom and @dmenne.

A DOI was minted at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3953159>.

# `ruODK` 0.6.6
This version addresses ROpenSci reviewer comments from @karissawhiting and
@jmt2080ad, contributions from @dickoa, as well as ideas and suggestions from
@OdiljonQurbon, @arestrom and @dmenne.

This version supports ODK Central 0.9 while providing backwards compatibility
for ODK Central <= 0.7.

## Major fixes
* New environment variables `ODKC_(TEST_)VERSION` allow `ruODK` to toggle
  between deprecated/removed and new/added API endpoints, e.g. `form_schema`. (#61)
* Split and rename WKT POINT (ODK geopoint) fields with
  `odata_submission_get(wkt=T)`. (#31 #7 HT @OdiljonQurbon)
* `submission_get` now accepts a vector of (all or selected) submission instance
  IDs (`iid`), similar to `odata_submission_get()`. (#38)
* All `httr::GET()` are now replaced with `httr::RETRY("GET", ...)` (#48)
* Refactor `odata_submission_parse()` into `odata_submission_rectangle()`,
  `handle_ru_{geopoints, geotraces, geoshapes, datetimes, attachments}`. (#54 #69)
* Maintain backwards compatibility to ODK Central v7 for changed spatial output
  for geotrace and geoshape (#70)

## Minor fixes
* Drop `. <- NULL` in favour of `utils::globalVariables(".")`. (#35)
* Print settings now hides passwords but instructs how to show them. (#37)
* `ru_setup()` now prints settings. (#37)
* `parse_datetime()` renamed to `ru_datetime()` to avoid naming conflict with
  `readr::parse_datetime()`. (#43)
* Add a global default for verbosity. (#51 HT @arestrom)
* Add a global default for time zone. (#53 HT @arestrom)
* Use `httr::modify_url` to build URLs rather than `glue::glue` (#66)
* Silenced spurious messages from `tibble::as_tibble()` which is called from
  `odata_submission_rectangle()`. Use `ru_verbose` to toggle useful diagnostic
  messages. (#79 HT @dmenne)
* Renamed `master` branch to `main`, updated docs (HT @arestrom #81)

## Dependencies
* Moved `rlist` to Imports, as it is now used in `odata_submission_get()`. (#6)
* Dropped `rlist` dependency in favour of `tidyr`/`dplyr`. (#85)
* Use development versions of `rlang`, `purrr` and `lifecycle` to get their
  latest bug fixes.

## Data
* Use canned data in all vignettes, so they can build without authentication.
  (#33)
* Update canned data (and `make-data.R`) to work with CI-built pkgdown site.
  (#52)
* Remove nested list `form_schema_raw` which is only generated from legacy
  ODK Central (< 0.8) (#61)
* Added ODK Central < v0.7 form schema for tests.

## Documentation
* Updated workshop companion package [urODK](https://github.com/dbca-wa/urODK).
* Rename vignettes to `odata-api` and `restful-api`. (#34)
* Warn against using plain text credentials in vignette `setup`. (#34)
* More documentation improvements at
  [#34](https://github.com/ropensci/ruODK/issues/34).
* Add screencast to the README. HT to asciicast! (#45)
* Improve logo - more turtles, but questionable photoshopping.
* Add examples where missing. (#32)
* Build pkgdown site via GH actions. (#52)
* Minor typographic changes: end every function title with a full stop.
* Broken links and other inconsistencies fixed after contributions from the
  ODK Forum, @dickoa, @arestrom, @dmenne.
  Thanks for the first community feedback! (#76 #74 #79 #80 #81)

## Docker
* Added Dockerfile to build an RStudio Server image based on `rocker/geospatial`
  with `ruODK` and dependencies installed.
* Build a separate Dockerfile for [`urODK`](https://github.com/dbca-wa/urODK)
  to launch a hosted RStudio instance in Binderhub. (#83)

# `ruODK` 0.6.6
* The big one has landed: `odata_submission_get()` now defaults to parse
  submissions from nested lists into a tibble, parse dates and datetimes,
  download and link attachments. (#6)

# `ruODK` 0.6.5
## Documentation
* Use lifecycle badges on functions. Add lifecycle to dependencies, version bump
  `usethis`. (#29)

## Code
* Refactor list wrangling code to use `map_*(.default=NA)`, removing some
  internal helpers (thanks to @jennybc)
* Use dummy imports to silence R CMD check NOTES as per [googledrive](https://github.com/tidyverse/googledrive/blob/050a982cba630503702bdde05a77d727baa36d48/R/googledrive-package.R)'s
  example (thanks to @jennybc)
* Drop unused internal helper functions

# `ruODK` 0.6.4
## Data
*  Use three new test forms to make package smaller and tests faster.
   Use the main test form for example data, including data from two nested tables.
   Use the main test form in all vignettes and README.
   Use a small form without attachments for tests repeatedly exporting to ZIP.
   Use another small form with only one submission and two attachments for tests
   downloading attachments.
   The test credentials are unchanged (#23)

# `ruODK` 0.6.3
## Dependencies
*  [tidyr 1.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/) is out!
  Move `{tidyr}` dependency from GitHub master to CRAN version (#27)
*  Add `{usethis}` to Suggests, it is used in the setup step

## Documentation
*  Add [David Henry](https://github.com/schemetrica)'s
  [Pentaho Kettle tutorial](https://forum.opendatakit.org/t/automating-data-delivery-using-the-odata-endpoint-in-odk-central/22010)
  to the software review in the README (#28)

## DIY for workshops
*  Add inaugural RMarkdown template "odata" (#26)
*  Add [binder](https://mybinder.org/) launch button (one click start for #26)

# `ruODK` 0.6.2
## Code
*  Simplifiy `ru_setup()` to use OData Service URL.
*  Change all functions to default to `get_default{pid,fid,url,un,pw}()`, partly
  moving project ID (pid) and form ID (fid) to kwargs. This changes all examples,
  tests, vignettes, READMEs.
*  Reduce installed package size by sharing attachment files. Add new parameter
  `separate=FALSE` to `attachment_get` to prevent separating attachment files
  into subfolders named after their submission `uuid` (#22)

## Documentation
*  Add a high level overview diagram to README and `inst/joss/paper.md` to
  illustrate `ruODK`'s intended purpose in the ODK ecosystem (#19)
*  Added link to explain
  [environment variables and R startup](https://whattheyforgot.org/r-startup.html)
  to vignette "setup". @maelle
*  Add comparison of similar software to README (#25)

# `ruODK` 0.6.1
*  ROpenSci submission review [milestone](https://github.com/ropensci/ruODK/milestone/3),
  [discussion](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/335).
*  Updates to documentation (#13 #15 #17)
*  Group function docs (#18)
*  Update contribution guidelines and add account request issue template:
  How to run `ruODK` tests and build the vignettes (#15 #20)
*  Add dedicated `ru_setup()` and `ru_settings()`.
  Pat down functions for missing credentials and yell loudly but clearly about
  httr errors. (#16)
*  Drop `@importFrom` to reduce duplication. All external functions are prefixed
  with their package name already.
*  Add convenience helpers `attachment_link()` and `parse_datetime()`.
*  Use `janitor::clean_names()` on column names over home-grown helpers.
*  Since `submission_detail` is now metadata only, add `submission_get` to download
  submission data.

# `ruODK` 0.6.0
*  Version bump and lifecycle bump to indicate that `ruODK` is ready to be used
  against ODK Central 0.6.

# `ruODK` 0.6.0.9000
*  Version bump to match ODK Central's version.
*  Updated to match ODK Central's API at 0.6 (RESTful and OData) (c.f.).
*  Add commented out crosslinks to source code and related tests for convenience.
*  Encryption endpoints (new in 0.6) are not yet supported.
*  Audit logs supported, as they are a read-only export.

# `ruODK` 0.3.1
## Preparation for ROpenSci pre-submission
*  Check name with [`available::available("ruODK")`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#naming-your-package):
  *  Name valid: ✔
  *  Available on CRAN: ✔
  *  Available on Bioconductor: ✔
  *  Available on GitHub:  ✔
  *  Rude misinterpretations: none
  *  In summary: Package name seems to be OK. Well, ODK. OK, ruODK.
*  Added metadata via
  [`codemetar::write_codemeta("ruODK")`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#creating-metadata-for-your-package).
*  [Cross-platform](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#platforms):
  Runs on GNU/Linux (TravisCI) and on Windows (AppVeyor)
*  [Function naming](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#function-and-argument-naming)
  follows `object_verb`.
  *  `ruODK` uses verb singulars (e.g. `submission_list` to
  list multiple submissions), while ODK Central's API URLs use verb plurals.
  *  `ruODK` uses `snake_case`.
  *  Exception to `object_verb`:
    Functions operating on the OData endpoints are named `odata_object_verb`.
    Helper functions not related to API endpoints are named `verb_object`.
*  [Code style](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#code-style) done
  by `styler::style_package()`, see section "Release" in `README.md`.
*  `ruODK` [has a `README.Rmd`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#readme)
  and has a
  [website generated by `pkgdown`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#website).
*  `ruODK` has documentation
  [generated by `roxygen2`](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#documentation).
*  [Test coverage](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#testing) 100%, but
  could use more edge cases.
*  Tests use a live ODK Central instance, which is kept up to date by ODK.
  This means that ruODK's test always run against the latest master of ODK Central.
  `ruODK` does not (but maybe should?) use `webmockr` and `vcr`.
*  Spellchecks with `spelling::spell_check_package()`: added technical terms and
  function names to `inst/WORDLIST`.
*  Added citation and section in `README`.
*  Added `inst/joss/paper.md` for submission to JOSS.
*  Added [examples](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#examples) to
  function docs.

## TODO
*  Implement remaining missing functions ([ticket](https://github.com/ropensci/ruODK/issues/9)).

# `ruODK` 0.3.0
*  Use tidyverse issue template
*  Follow `goodpractice`
*  Created vignette "Setup"
*  Add AppVeyor
*  Refactor storage path of attachments to not contain "uuid:" (for Windows compat)
*  Started on REST API: `project_list`, `project_detail`, `form_list`,
  `form_detail`. Naming scheme is `object_verb`.
*  For now, functions related to the OData endpoint
  are named `verb_object`, maybe we should rename them to `odata_object_verb`.
*  Refactor URLs - build from project and form IDs

# `ruODK` 0.2.4
*  Cleaned up logo, thanks to @issa-tseng for suggestions

# `ruODK` 0.2.3
*  Added a new form, Flora Quadrat 0.3 to inst/extdata.

# `ruODK` 0.2.2
*  Added more test coverage.

# `ruODK` 0.2.1
*  Added various `usethis` goodies, test stubs, badges.

# `ruODK` 0.2.0
*  Recursively unnests raw data into wide format. Manual post-processing is still
  required to rename (anonymous in ODK and auto-named through R) coordinates,
  and to handle attachments.

# `ruODK` 0.1.0
*  Parses metadata, submissions,
  and handles attachments (retaining already downloaded attachments).
*  Includes example forms as both `.xml` and `.odbbuild` in `inst/extdata`.
*  Includes example data as retrieved from ODK Central.
*  Includes vignette demonstrating tidying of retrieved data.
*  Handles repeating groups.

Roadmap:

*  Handle paginated submissions.
*  Retain already downloaded submissions.
