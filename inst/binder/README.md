# urODK - You, R, and ODK: A sing-along ruODK workshop
This document contains the outline of a workshop where within about one hour,
we’ll build an electronic data capture pipeline from
form design to data analysis and dissemination using ODK and `ruODK`.

Before we start, read the brief
[overview](https://docs.ropensci.org/ruODK/) of electronic data capture
using ODK, and how `ruODK` fits into that picture.

## Build a form <a href="#build"></a>

There are many ways to create a valid XForm. The friendliest way is to
use ODK Build, a drag-and-drop online form designer.

Reference: [ODK Build docs](https://docs.getodk.org/build-intro/)

  - Sign up at [build.getodk.org](https://build.getodk.org/)
  - [Build a form](https://docs.getodk.org/build-intro/#form-building),
    save, [export as
    XML](https://docs.getodk.org/build-intro/#export-forms). (10 min)

Dirty tricks:

  - You can open ODK Build in more than one browser tabs.
  - You can select (or shift-select several) widgets, then drag and drop
    them between ODK Build forms.
  - You can bulk-edit select1 options, paste from a spreadsheet, and
    save them for future re-use across forms.

Fail-safe: Use any of the [ruODK example
forms](https://github.com/ropensci/ruODK/tree/master/inst/extdata).

## Distribute form

The Xform is distributed via ODK Central.

Reference: [ODK Central docs](https://docs.getodk.org/central-using/)

  - Request an ODK Central account by invitation or by asking the
    workshop presenter (10 min pre workshop):
      - you’ll need an email, which will become your ODK Central
        username
      - you’ll receive a sign-up email with instructions to set up your
        ODK Central password
  - Create a project, create a form, upload the XML from ODK Build. (5
    min)
  - Create an app user on the project, open the QR code from “configure
    client”.

Fail-safe: The presenter can show the QR code for an example project on
a ODK Central server.

## Collect data

Data collection happens on an Android device using ODK Collect.

Reference: [ODK Collect docs](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-using/)

  - Install ODK Collect to your Android device from the Google Play
    Store. (5 min)
  - Open ODK Collect \> Menu \> Admin Settings \> Import Settings \>
    Scan QR code.
  - Get blank forms (1 min)

Data can now be captured and sent via WiFi or cellular network (see ODK
Collect settings). (10 min)

Fail-safe: The presenter can bring a few pre-configured Android devices.
The example forms already contain collected data.

## Analyse data <a href="#ru-ready-to-rock"></a>

Run through the steps shown in the first part of the README:

  - Install `ruODK`. (10 min pre workshop)
  - Configure `ruODK` through .Renviron (ODK Central un, pw, default
    project/form). (5 min)
  - Create an Rmd from template “OData” and follow instructions within.
    (15 min)

### Install ruODK

  - To run the `ruODK` workshop in a hosted, disposable RStudio
    instance, hit the “binder” button.
  - To install `ruODK` in your own environment, run this (preferably
    ahead of the workshop to allow time for troubleshooting):

You can install the latest release of `ruODK` from the [rOpenSci
R-Universe](https://ropensci.r-universe.dev):

``` r
# Enable the rOpenSci universe
options(repos = c(ropensci = 'https://ropensci.r-universe.dev',
                  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
install.packages('ruODK')
```

See the ruODK README for other installation options.

### Configure ruODK

Add your ODK Central credentials to `.Renviron` via
`usethis::edit_r_environ()` (with your own `un` and `pw`):

``` r
ODKC_URL="https://myodkcentral.org"
ODKC_PID=14
ODKC_FID="my-form-id"
ODKC_UN="xxx"
ODKC_PW="xxx"
```

### Create a report

Start with a colour-by-numbers workflow example: If using RStudio,
create a new RMarkdown workbook “from template” and select `ruODK`’s
template “ODK Central via OData”, or run the next chunk with a file name
of your choice:

``` r
rmarkdown::draft("my_example.Rmd", "odata", package="ruODK")
```

Follow the instructions in the workbook to explore the data. Now u r ODK!
